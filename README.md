# Juno Farm Hackathon


Considerations:
- per address profiles (address = 1 farm)
- Query others farms info
- User inventory of seeds / items
- single leaderboard idea

Logic:
- Start with grass (till into dirt (cost 1 block of time))
- If dirt is not planted in 3-6 hours, turn back to grass (on try to plant, error our for its back to grass. Then set it to grass)

- tilled dirt, add a seed to plant
    different seeds take different amounts of time to grow
    after X blocks, allow them to be harvested'

- Increase farm size for a fee (JUNO, or tokenfactory)


Expand Ideas:
- Use v13 FeeShare
- Use TokenFactory for Seeds / equiptment  (ex: watering can).
